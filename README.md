# challenge-6

The Weather Dashboard is a user-friendly web application with a simple form input. When you search for a city, the dashboard provides you with both the current and future weather conditions for that location. The city you searched for is also added to the search history. For the current weather, you'll see the city name, date, weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The future weather conditions display a 5-day forecast with date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. If you click on a city in the search history, the dashboard will show you the current and future conditions for that city again
